ramblings and planning notes
- loop:
   - read new image
   - predict
   - measure
   - update
   - map management




- map:
	- X vector
	- P matrix
	- camera
	- features



camera:
	- labelref
	- intrinsic
	methods:
		- predict( new_x, jacobi, dt )
		- project_point()



feature:
	- camera pose at detection
	- image patch
	- labelRef
	- times predicted
	- times measured
	- havent measured since
	- calculated:
		- predicted to apear this frame?
		- predicted UV coords
		- warped patch
		- 

	methods:
		- static create( map, picture )
		- predict( new_x, jacobi, dt )
		- create( map, picture, uv )
		- measure( image )
		- update( measurement, jacobi )
		- should_delete



- testing
	- measurements from file
	- rendered image sequences
	- real data
